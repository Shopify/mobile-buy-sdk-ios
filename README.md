# Mobile Buy SDK

The Mobile Buy SDK makes it easy to create custom storefronts in your mobile app. The SDK connects to the Shopify platform using the Storefront GraphQL API and supports a wide range of native storefront experiences.

## Installation

<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/mobile-buy-sdk-ios/releases/latest">Download the latest version</a>

### Versioning

As of the `2025.1.0` release, the Mobile Buy SDK now uses a modified [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning scheme. This was done to align with the quarterly Storefront GraphQL API releases and bring clarity to what version a library release corresponds to.

The format is `yyyy.mm.patch`, where the first two components match the API version, and the last component corresponds to non-breaking bug fixes within an API version cycle. In practice, this means that unlike SemVer, there **may** be breaking GraphQL schema changes between "minor" versions. Learn more about API [release schedules](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning#release-schedule) at Shopify.

### Swift Package Manager

This is the recommended approach of integration the SDK with your app. You can follow Apple's guide for [adding a package dependency to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) for a thorough walkthrough.

### Dynamic Framework Installation

1. Add `Buy` as a git submodule by running:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:Shopify/mobile-buy-sdk-ios.git
```

2. Ensure that all submodules of `Buy SDK` have also been updated by running:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Drag the `Buy.xcodeproj` into your application project.
4. Add **Buy.framework** target as a dependency:
   1. Navigate to **Build Phases** > **Target Dependencies**.
   2. Add `Buy.framework`.
5. Link `Buy.framework`:
   1. Navigate to **Build Phases** > **Link Binary With Libraries**.
   2. Add `Buy.framework`.
6. Make sure that the framework is copied into the bundle:
   1. Navigate to **Build Phases** > **New Copy Files Phase**.
   2. From the **Destination** dropdown, select **Frameworks**.
   3. Add `Buy.framework`.
7. Import into your project files using `import Buy`.

See the **Storefront** sample app for an example of how to add the `Buy` target a dependency.

### Carthage

1. Add the following line to your Cartfile:

```ruby
github "Shopify/mobile-buy-sdk-ios"
```

2. Run `carthage update`.
3. Follow the [steps to link the dynamic framework](#dynamic-framework-installation-) that Carthage produced.
4. Import the SDK module:

```swift
import Buy
```

### CocoaPods

1. Add the following line to your podfile:

```ruby
pod "Mobile-Buy-SDK"
```

2. Run `pod install`.
3. Import the SDK module:

```swift
import MobileBuySDK
```

Note: If you've forked this repo and are attempting to install from your own git destination, commit, or branch, be sure to include "submodules: true" in the line of your Podfile

## Getting started

The Buy SDK is built on [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). The SDK handles all the query generation and response parsing, exposing only typed models and compile-time checked query structures. It doesn't require you to write stringed queries, or parse JSON responses.

You don't need to be an expert in GraphQL to start using it with the Buy SDK (but it helps if you've used it before). The sections below provide a brief introduction to this system, and some examples of how you can use it to build secure custom storefronts.

## Migration from SDK v2.0

The previous version of the Mobile Buy SDK (version 2.0) is based on a REST API. With version 3.0, Shopify is migrating the SDK from REST to GraphQL.

Unfortunately, the specifics of generation GraphQL models make it almost impossible to create a migration path from v2.0 to v3.0 (domains models are not backwards compatible). However, the main concepts are the same across the two versions, such as collections, products, checkouts, and orders.

## Code Generation

The Buy SDK is built on a hierarchy of generated classes that construct and parse GraphQL queries and responses. These classes are generated manually by running a custom Ruby script that relies on the [GraphQL Swift Generation](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql_swift_gen) library. Most of the generation functionality and supporting classes live inside the library. It works by downloading the GraphQL schema, generating Swift class hierarchy, and saving the generated files to the specified folder path. In addition, it provides overrides for custom GraphQL scalar types like `DateTime`.

### Request Models

All generated request models are derived from the `GraphQL.AbstractQuery` type. Although this abstract type contains enough functionality to build a query, you should never use it directly. Instead, rely on the typed methods provided in the generated subclasses.

The following example shows a sample query for a shop's name:

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .shop { $0
        .name()
    }
}
```

Never use the abstract class directly:

```swift
// Never do this

let shopQuery = GraphQL.AbstractQuery()
shopQuery.addField(field: "name")

let query = GraphQL.AbstractQuery()
query.addField(field: "shop", subfields: shopQuery)

```

Both of the above queries produce identical GraphQL queries (see below), but the former approach provides auto-completion and compile-time validation against the GraphQL schema. It will surface an error if a requested field doesn't exist, isn't the correct type, or is deprecated. You also might have noticed that the former approach resembles the GraphQL query language structure (this is intentional). The query is both easier to write and much more legible.

```graphql
query {
  shop {
    name
  }
}
```

### Response models

All generated response models are derived from the `GraphQL.AbstractResponse` type. This abstract type provides a similar key-value type interface to a `Dictionary` for accessing field values in GraphQL responses. Just like `GraphQL.AbstractQuery`, you should never use these accessors directly, and instead rely on typed, derived properties in generated subclasses.

The following example builds on the earlier example of accessing the result of a shop name query:

```swift
// response: Storefront.QueryRoot

let name: String = response.shop.name
```

Never use the abstract class directly:

```swift
// Never do this

let response: GraphQL.AbstractResponse

let shop = response.field("shop") as! GraphQL.AbstractResponse
let name = shop.field("name") as! String
```

Again, both of the approaches produce the same result, but the former case is preferred: it requires no casting since it already knows about the expected type.

### The `Node` protocol

The GraphQL schema defines a `Node` interface that declares an `id` field on any conforming type. This makes it convenient to query for any object in the schema given only its `id`. The concept is carried across to the Buy SDK as well, but requires a cast to the correct type. You need to make sure that the `Node` type is of the correct type, otherwise casting to an incorrect type will return a runtime exception.

Given this query:

```swift
let id    = GraphQL.ID(rawValue: "gid://shopify/Product/123")
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .node(id: id) { $0
        .onProduct { $0
            .id()
            .title()
        }
    }
}
```

The `Storefront.Product` requires a cast:

```swift
// response: Storefront.QueryRoot

let product = response.node as! Storefront.Product
```

#### Aliases

Aliases are useful when a single query requests multiple fields with the same names at the same nesting level, since GraphQL allows only unique field names. Multiple nodes can be queried by using a unique alias for each one:

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .node(aliasSuffix: "collection", id: GraphQL.ID(rawValue: "NkZmFzZGZhc")) { $0
        .onCollection { $0
            // fields for Collection
        }
    }
    .node(aliasSuffix: "product", id: GraphQL.ID(rawValue: "GZhc2Rm")) { $0
        .onProduct { $0
            // fields for Product
        }
    }
}
```

Accessing the aliased nodes is similar to a plain node:

```swift
// response: Storefront.QueryRoot

let collection = response.aliasedNode(aliasSuffix: "collection") as! Storefront.Collection
let product    = response.aliasedNode(aliasSuffix: "product")    as! Storefront.Product
```

Learn more about [GraphQL aliases](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases).

## Graph.Client

The `Graph.Client` is a network layer built on top of `URLSession` that executes `query` and `mutation` requests. It also simplifies polling and retrying requests. To get started with `Graph.Client`, you need the following:

- Your shop's `.myshopify.com` domain
- Your API key, which you can find in your shop's admin page
- A `URLSession` (optional), if you want to customize the configuration used for network requests or share your existing `URLSession` with the `Graph.Client`
- (optional) The buyer's current locale. Supported values are limited to locales available to your shop.

```swift
let client = Graph.Client(
	shopDomain: "shoes.myshopify.com",
	apiKey:     "dGhpcyBpcyBhIHByaXZhdGUgYXBpIGtleQ"
)
```

If your store supports multiple languages, then the Storefront API can return translated resource types and fields. Learn more about [translating content](https://shopify.dev/tutorials/manage-app-translations-with-admin-api).

```swift
// Initializing a client to return translated content
let client = Graph.Client(
	shopDomain: "shoes.myshopify.com",
	apiKey:     "dGhpcyBpcyBhIHByaXZhdGUgYXBpIGtleQ",
        locale:     Locale.current
)
```

GraphQL specifies two types of operations: queries and mutations. The `Client` exposes these as two type-safe operations, although it also offers some conveniences for retrying and polling in each one.

### Queries

Semantically, a GraphQL `query` operation is equivalent to a `GET` RESTful call. It guarantees that no resources will be mutated on the server. With `Graph.Client`, you can perform a query operation using:

```swift
public func queryGraphWith(_ query: Storefront.QueryRootQuery, retryHandler: RetryHandler<Storefront.QueryRoot>? = default, completionHandler: QueryCompletion) -> Task
```

The following example shows how you can query for a shop's name:

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .shop { $0
        .name()
    }
}

let task = client.queryGraphWith(query) { response, error in
    if let response = response {
        let name = response.shop.name
    } else {
        print("Query failed: \(error)")
    }
}
task.resume()
```

Learn more about [GraphQL queries](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/).

### Mutations

Semantically a GraphQL `mutation` operation is equivalent to a `PUT`, `POST` or `DELETE` RESTful call. A mutation is almost always accompanied by an input that represents values to be updated and a query to fetch fields of the updated resource. You can think of a `mutation` as a two-step operation where the resource is first modified, and then queried using the provided `query`. The second half of the operation is identical to a regular `query` request.

With `Graph.Client` you can perform a mutation operation using:

```swift
public func mutateGraphWith(_ mutation: Storefront.MutationQuery, retryHandler: RetryHandler<Storefront.Mutation>? = default, completionHandler: MutationCompletion) -> Task
```

The following example shows how you can reset a customer's password using a recovery token:

```swift
let customerID = GraphQL.ID(rawValue: "YSBjdXN0b21lciBpZA")
let input      = Storefront.CustomerResetInput.create(resetToken: "c29tZSB0b2tlbiB2YWx1ZQ", password: "abc123")
let mutation   = Storefront.buildMutation { $0
    .customerReset(id: customerID, input: input) { $0
        .customer { $0
            .id()
            .firstName()
            .lastName()
        }
        .userErrors { $0
            .field()
            .message()
        }
    }
}

let task = client.mutateGraphWith(mutation) { response, error in
    if let mutation = response?.customerReset {

        if let customer = mutation.customer, !mutation.userErrors.isEmpty {
            let firstName = customer.firstName
            let lastName = customer.lastName
        } else {

            print("Failed to reset password. Encountered invalid fields:")
            mutation.userErrors.forEach {
                let fieldPath = $0.field?.joined() ?? ""
                print("  \(fieldPath): \($0.message)")
            }
        }

    } else {
        print("Failed to reset password: \(error)")
    }
}
task.resume()
```

A mutation will often rely on some kind of user input. Although you should always validate user input before posting a mutation, there are never guarantees when it comes to dynamic data. For this reason, you should always request the `userErrors` field on mutations (where available) to provide useful feedback in your UI regarding any issues that were encountered in the mutation query. These errors can include anything from `Invalid email address` to `Password is too short`.

Learn more about [GraphQL mutations](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations).

### Retry

Both `queryGraphWith` and `mutateGraphWith` accept an optional `RetryHandler<R: GraphQL.AbstractResponse>`. This object encapsulates the retry state and customization parameters for how the `Client` will retry subsequent requests (such as after a set delay, or a number of retries). By default, the `retryHandler` is nil and no retry behavior will be provided. To enable retry or polling, create a handler with a condition. If the `handler.condition` and `handler.canRetry` evaluate to `true`, then the `Client` will continue executing the request:

```swift
let handler = Graph.RetryHandler<Storefront.QueryRoot>() { (query, error) -> Bool in
    if myCondition {
        return true // will retry
    }
    return false // will complete the request, either succeed or fail
}
```

The retry handler is generic, and can handle both `query` and `mutation` requests equally well.

### Caching

Network queries and mutations can be both slow and expensive. For resources that change infrequently, you might want to use caching to help reduce both bandwidth and latency. Since GraphQL relies on `POST` requests, we can't easily take advantage of the HTTP caching that's available in `URLSession`. For this reason, the `Graph.Client` is equipped with an opt-in caching layer that can be enabled client-wide or on a per-request basis.

**IMPORTANT:** Caching is provided only for `query` operations. It isn't available for `mutation` operations or for any other requests that provide a `retryHandler`.

There are four available cache policies:

- `.cacheOnly` - Fetch a response from the cache only, ignoring the network. If the cached response doesn't exist, then return an error.
- `.networkOnly` - Fetch a response from the network only, ignoring any cached responses.
- `.cacheFirst(expireIn: Int)` - Fetch a response from the cache first. If the response doesn't exist or is older than `expireIn`, then fetch a response from the network
- `.networkFirst(expireIn: Int)` - Fetch a response from the network first. If the network fails and the cached response isn't older than `expireIn`, then return cached data instead.

#### Enable client-wide caching

You can enable client-wide caching by providing a default `cachePolicy` for any instance of `Graph.Client`. This sets all `query` operations to use your default cache policy, unless you specify an alternate policy for an individual request.

In this example, we set the client's `cachePolicy` property to `cacheFirst`:

```swift
let client = Graph.Client(shopDomain: "...", apiKey: "...")
client.cachePolicy = .cacheFirst
```

Now, all calls to `queryGraphWith` will yield a task with a `.cacheFirst` cache policy.

If you want to override a client-wide cache policy for an individual request, then specify an alternate cache policy as a parameter of `queryGraphWith`:

```swift
let task = client.queryGraphWith(query, cachePolicy: .networkFirst(expireIn: 20)) { query, error in
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `task` cache policy changes to `.networkFirst(expireIn: 20)`, which means that the cached response will be valid for 20 seconds from the time the response is received.

### Errors

The completion for either a `query` or `mutation` request will always contain an optional `Graph.QueryError` that represents the current error state of the request. **It's important to note that `error` and `response` are NOT mutually exclusive.** It is perfectly valid to have a non-nil error and response. The presence of an error can represent both a network error (such as a network error, or invalid JSON) or a GraphQL error (such as invalid query syntax, or a missing parameter). The `Graph.QueryError` is an `enum`, so checking the type of error is trivial:

```swift
let task = client.queryGraphWith(query) { response, error in
    if let response = response {
        // Do something
    } else {

        if let error = error, case .http(let statusCode) = error {
            print("Query failed. HTTP error code: \(statusCode)")
        }
    }
}
task.resume()
```

If the error is of type `.invalidQuery`, then an array of `Reason` objects is returned. These will provide more in-depth information about the query error. Keep in mind that these errors are not meant to be displayed to the end-user. **They are for debugging purposes only**.

The following example shows a GraphQL error response for an invalid query:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Field 'Shop' doesn't exist on type 'QueryRoot'",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 90
        }
      ],
      "fields": ["query CollectionsWithProducts", "Shop"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Learn more about [GraphQL errors](http://graphql.org/learn/validation/).

## Common Operations

Getting started with any SDK can be confusing. The purpose of this section is to explore all areas of the Buy SDK that might be necessary to build a custom storefront on iOS and provide a solid starting point for your own implementation.

In this section we're going to assume that you've [set up a client](#graphclient) somewhere in your source code. Although it's possible to have multiple instances of `Graph.Client`, reusing a single instance offers many behind-the-scenes performance improvements:

```swift
let client: Graph.Client
```

### Retrieving Shop Details

Before you display products to the user, you typically need to obtain various metadata about your shop. This can be anything from a currency code to your shop's name:

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .shop { $0
        .name()
    }
}

let task = client.queryGraphWith(query) { response, error in
    let name = response?.shop.name
}
task.resume()
```

The corresponding GraphQL query looks like this:

```graphql
query {
  shop {
    name
  }
}
```

### Retrieving Collections and Products

In our sample custom storefront, we want to display a collection with a preview of several products. The following query requests the first 10 collections, and the first 10 products in each collection.

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .collections(first: 10) { $0
        .nodes { $0
            .id()
            .title()
            .products(first: 10) { $0
                .nodes { $0
                    .id()
                    .title()
                    .productType()
                    .description()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

let task = client.queryGraphWith(query) { response, error in
    if let collections = response?.collections.nodes {
        collections.forEach { collection in
            let products = collection.products.nodes
        }
    }
}
task.resume()
```

The corresponding GraphQL query looks like this:

```graphql
{
  collections(first: 10) {
    nodes {
      id
      title
      products(first: 10) {
        nodes {
          id
          title
          productType
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Retrieve a Product's Details

You will likely want to have a detailed product page with images, variants, and descriptions. Once you have a product's ID or `handle` value, we can request it directly.

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .product(handle: "t-shirt") { $0
		.title()
		.description()
		.images(first: 10) { $0
            .nodes { $0
                .url()
            }
        }
		.variants(first: 50) { $0
			.nodes { $0
                .id()
                .title()
                .price { $0
                    .amount()
                    .currencyCode()
                }
                .availableForSale()
			}
		}
	}
}

let task = client.queryGraphWith(query) { response, error in
    let product  = response?.product
    let images   = product?.images.nodes
    let variants = product?.variants.nodes
}

task.resume()
```

The corresponding GraphQL query looks like this:

```graphql
{
  product(handle: "t-shirt") {
    title
    description
    images(first: 10) {
      nodes {
        url
      }
    }
    variants(first: 50) {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        price {
          amount
          currencyCode
        }
        availableForSale
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Search and Filtering

Some fields and connections accept search terms via the `query` parameter. For example, you can provide a `query` to search for collections that contain a specific search term in any of their fields.

The following example shows how you can find collections that contain the word "shoes":

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .collections(first: 10, query: "shoes") { $0
         .nodes { $0
            .id()
            .title()
            .description()
        }
    }
}
```

For more information on the syntax and capabilities of search queries, see [shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/search-syntax).

### Managing Carts

Once you have your products displayed, you need a way for your prospective buyers to purchase them. This process starts with creating a `Cart`.

#### Creating a Cart

To create a `Cart`, you will use the `cartCreate` mutation. If you do not specify any input arguments, you will simply get an empty `Cart`.

```swift
let createCartMutation = Storefront.buildMutation { $0
    .cartCreate { $0
        .cart { $0
            .id()
        }
    }
}
```

However, you can also create a `Cart` with an initial set of line items and other attributes.

```swift
let aProductVariantID = // a product variant ID

let linesInput: [Storefront.CartLineInput] = [
    .create(merchandiseId: aProductVariantID, quantity: .value(5))
]

let buyerIdentityInput = Storefront.CartBuyerIdentityInput.create(
    email: .value("your.customer@example.com")
)

let cartInput = Storefront.CartInput.create(
    lines: .value(linesInput), buyerIdentity: .value(buyerIdentityInput)
)

let createCartMutation = Storefront.buildMutation { $0
    .cartCreate(input: cartInput) { $0
        .cart { $0
            .id()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Modifying a Cart

Once you have a `Cart` object (or at least an ID to one), you can modify its contents and attributes using several available mutations. Below are a few common examples.

##### Removing a Line Item

```swift
let removeCartLineMutation = Storefront.buildMutation { $0
    .cartLinesRemove(cartId: myCartID, lineIds: [myCartLineID]) { $0
        .cart { $0
            .id()
        }
    }
}
```

##### Adding a Discount Code

```swift
let updateDiscountCodeMutation = Storefront.buildMutation { $0
    .cartDiscountCodesUpdate(cartId: myCartID, discountCodes: ["10OFF"]) { $0
        .cart { $0
            .id()
        }
    }
}
```

For more information about managing carts, see [shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/building-with-the-storefront-api/cart/manage).

### Proceeding to Checkout

Once you have a `Cart` object that the buyer is ready to purchase, you first must retrieve the cart's `checkoutUrl` property.

```swift
let cartQuery = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .cart(id: aCartID) { $0
        .checkoutUrl()
    }
}
```

Once you have the checkout URL, you have a few options to begin the checkout process.

Our **recommended approach** is to use our [Mobile Checkout SDK](https://github.com/Shopify/mobile-checkout-sdk-ios) which provides a native look and feel to Shopify's checkout flow.

```swift
import UIKit
import ShopifyCheckout

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    func proceedToCheckout() {
        let checkoutURL = // retrieve from your `Cart` object

        ShopifyCheckout.present(
            checkout: checkoutURL, from: self, delegate: self
        )
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can open the checkout URL directly in a `SFSafariViewController`, via `UIApplication.shared.open(url:)`, or other web browser.

```swift
import UIKit
import SafariServices

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    func proceedToCheckout() {
        let checkoutURL = // retrieve from your `Cart` object

        present(SFSafariViewController(url: checkoutURL), animated: true)
    }
}
```

### Customer Authentication

Any customer who has an account can log in to your shop. All log-in operations are `mutation` requests that exchange customer credentials for an access token. You can log in your customers using the `customerAccessTokenCreate` mutation. Keep in mind that the return access token will eventually expire. The expiry `Date` is provided by the `expiresAt` property of the returned payload.

```swift
let input = Storefront.CustomerAccessTokenCreateInput.create(
    email: "john.smith@gmail.com", password: "123456"
)

let mutation = Storefront.buildMutation { $0
    .customerAccessTokenCreate(input: input) { $0
        .customerAccessToken { $0
            .accessToken()
            .expiresAt()
        }
        .userErrors { $0
            .field()
            .message()
        }
    }
}
```

Optionally, you can refresh the custom access token periodically using the `customerAccessTokenRenew` mutation.

**IMPORTANT:** It is your responsibility to securely store the customer access token. We recommend using Keychain and best practices for storing secure data.

### Retrieve Customer Details

Once you have a valid customer access token, you can use it to retrieve the details of the authenticated customer.

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .customer(customerAccessToken: token) { $0
        .id()
        .firstName()
        .lastName()
        .email()
    }
}
```
