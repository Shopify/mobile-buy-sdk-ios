### Getting started

The Buy SDK is built on top of [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). While some knowledge of GraphQL is good to have, you don't have to be an expert to start using it with the Buy SDK. Instead of writing stringed queries and parsing JSON responses, the SDK handles all the query generation and response parsing, exposing only typed models and compile-time checked query structures. The section below will give a brief introduction to this system and provide some examples of how it makes building custom storefronts safe and easy.

### Code Generation

The Buy SDK is built on a hierarchy of generated classes that generate and parse GraphQL queries and response. These classes are generated manually by running a custom Ruby script that relies on the [GraphQL Swift Generation](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql_swift_gen) library. Majority of the generation functinality lives inside the library with the script only providing overrides for custom GraphQL scalar types. The library also includes supporting classes that are required by generated query and response models.

#### Request Models

All generated request models are derived from the `GraphQL.AbstractQuery` type. While this abstract type does contain enough functionality to build a query, you should never use it directly. Let's take a look at an example query for a shop's name:

```swift
// Never do this

let shopQuery = GraphQL.AbstractQuery()
shopQuery.addField(field: "name")

let query = GraphQL.AbstractQuery()
query.addField(field: "shop", subfields: shopQuery)

```
Instead, rely on the typed methods provided in the generated subclasses:

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .shop { $0
        .name()
    }
}
```

Both of the above queries will produce identical GraphQL queries (below) but the latter apporach provides auto-completion and compile-time validation against the GraphQL schema. It will surface an error if requested fields don't exists, aren't the correct type or are deprecated. You also may have noticed that the latter approach resembles the pure GraphQL query structure, and this is intentional. The query is both much more legible and easier to write.

```graphql
{ 
  shop { 
    name 
  } 
}
```

#### Response Models

All generated response models are derived from the `GraphQL.AbstractResponse` type. This abstract type provides a similar key-value type interface to a `Dictionary` for accessing field values in GraphQL responses. Just like `GraphQL.AbstractQuery`, you should never use these accessors directly, and instead opt for typed, derived properties in generated subclasses in stead. Let's continue the example of accessing the result of a shop name query:

```swift
// Never do this

let response: GraphQL.AbstractResponse

let shop = response.field("shop") as! GraphQL.AbstractResponse
let name = shop.field("name") as! String
```
Instead, use the typed accessors in generated subclasses:

```swift
// response: Storefront.QueryRoot

let name: String = response.shop.name
```

Again, both of the approach produce the same result but the latter case is safe and requires no casting as it already knows about the expect type.

#### The `Node` protocol

GraphQL defines a `Node` interface that declares an `id` field on any conforming type. This makes it convenient to query for any object in the schema given only it's `id`. The concept is carried across to Buy SDK as well but requeries a cast to the correct type. Given this query:

```swift
let id    = GraphQL.ID(rawValue: "NkZmFzZGZhc")
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .node(id: id) { $0
        .onOrder { $0
            .id()
            .createdAt()
        }
    }
}
```
accessing the order requires a cast:

```swift
// response: Storefront.QueryRoot

let order = response.node as! Storefront.Order
```

##### Aliases

Aliases are useful when a single query contain multiple node fields. GraphQL allows only unique fields but multiple nodes would produce a collision. This is where aliases come in. Multiple nodes can be queried by using a unique alias for each one:

```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .node(aliasSuffix: "collection", id: GraphQL.ID(rawValue: "NkZmFzZGZhc")) { $0
        .onCollection { $0
            // fields for Collection
        }
    }
    .node(aliasSuffix: "product", id: GraphQL.ID(rawValue: "GZhc2Rm")) { $0
        .onProduct { $0
            // fields for Product
        }
    }
}
```
Accessing the aliased nodes is similar to a plain node:

```swift
// response: Storefront.QueryRoot

let collection = response.aliasedNode(aliasSuffix: "collection") as! Storefront.Collection
let product    = response.aliasedNode(aliasSuffix: "product")    as! Storefront.Product
```

### Types and models

The Buy SDK provides classes for models that represent resources in the GraphQL schema 1-to-1. These classes are all scoped under the `Storefront` namespace. To access these classes you'll need to provide the entire name:

```swift
let collections: [Storefront.Collection] = []
collection.forEach {
    $0.doSomething()
}
```

Initialize the `GraphClient` with your credentials from the *Mobile App Channel*

```swift
let client = GraphClient(shopDomain: "yourshop.myshopify.com", apiKey: "your-api-key")
```

### Queries & Mutations

The Buy SDK is built on GraphQL, which means that you'll inherit all the powerful capabilities GraphQL has to offer. As a result, there's a paradigm shift. With Buy SDK, you'll need to "query" the API and describe in the shape of an object graph what kind of fields and entities the server should return. Let's take a look at how to build a simple query.

GraphQL queries are written in plain text but the SDK offers a builder that abstracts the knowledge of the GraphQL schema and provides auto-completion. There are two types of queries:

#### Query
Using the `buildQuery()` method, we can build a query to retrieve entities and fields. Semantically, these are requivalent to `GET` requests in RESTful APIs. No reasource are modified as a result of a `query`.
```swift
let query = Storefront.buildQuery { $0
    .shop {
        .name()
        .currencyCode()
        .moneyFormat()
    }
}
```
this will produce the following GraphQL query:
```graphql
query {
	shop {
    	name
        currencyCode
        moneyFormat
    }
}
```

#### Mutation
Using the `buildMutation()` method, we can a build a query to modify resources on the server. Semantically, these are equivalent to `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests in RESTful APIs.
```swift
let mutation = Storefront.buildMutation { $0
    .customerCreate(input: customerInput) { $0
        .customer { $0
            .displayName()
            .firstName()
            .lastName()
        }
    }
}
```

Mutations are slightly different. Unlike simple queries, mutations can require an input object to represent the resource to be created or updated. The above `customerInput` parameter is created by simply initializing a `Storefront.CustomerInput` object like this:
```swift
let customerInput = Storefront.CustomerInput(
    firstName: "John",
    lastName:  "Smith",
    email:     "john.smith@gmail.com",
    password:  "johnny123",
    acceptsMarketing: true
)
```
The above will yield the following GraphQL query:
```graphql
mutation {
	customerCreate(input: {
    	firstName: "John"
        lastName:  "Smith"
        email:     "john.smith@gmail.com"
        password:  "johnny123"
        acceptsMarketing: true
    }) {
    	customer {
    		displayName
        	firstName
        	lastName
        }
    }
}
```

### Query Arguments
Example of query arguments:
```graphql
{
  shop {
    products(first:50, sortKey: TITLE) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Errors
Example of GraphQL error reponse:
```graphql
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Field 'Shop' doesn't exist on type 'QueryRoot'",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 90
        }
      ],
      "fields": [
        "query CollectionsWithProducts",
        "Shop"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
