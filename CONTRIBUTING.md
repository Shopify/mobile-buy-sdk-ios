# How to contribute

We welcome contributions to the Mobile Buy SDK. But before you contribute, make sure that you're familiar with the guidelines below.

## Things we will merge

* Bugfixes
* Performance improvements
* Features that are likely to be useful to the majority of users

## Things we won't merge

* Code that adds no significant value to the SDK
* Code that comes without tests
* Code that breaks existing tests

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo, and branch off of `develop`.
2. Create a new branch in your fork.
3. If it makes sense to add tests for your code, then do so (and make sure that they pass).
5. Create a pull request.
