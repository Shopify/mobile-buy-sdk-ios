# How to contribute

We welcome contributions to the Mobile Buy SDK. But before you contribute, make sure that you're familiar with the guidelines below.

## Things we will merge

* Bugfixes
* Performance improvements
* Features that are likely to be useful to the majority of users

## Things we won't merge

* Code that adds no significant value to the SDK
* Code that comes without tests
* Code that breaks existing tests

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo and branch off of `develop`.
2. Create a new branch in your fork.
3. If it makes sense to add tests for your code, then do so.
4. Add any new keys to `test_shop_data.json`, but don't check in their values.
5. Make sure all tests pass.
6. Create a pull request.
